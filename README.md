## About:
A simple game developed by me [hitalojta](https://github.com/hitalojta) using Python and the pygame library. The objective here was to learn how to make a game and try to contextualize it with the current situation (pandemic) we are facing right now. Hope you like it! :blush:

I will improve it over time, so, keep tuned for updates! :wink:
